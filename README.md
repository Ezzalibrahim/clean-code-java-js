## Introduction
![Humorous image of software quality estimation as a count of how many expletives
you shout when reading code](http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg)

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
[*Clean Code*](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882),
adapted for Java. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
[readable, reusable, and refactorable](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/3rs-of-software-architecture) software in Java.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be
universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are
ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of
*Clean Code*.

Our craft of software engineering is just a bit over 50 years old, and we are
still learning a lot. When software architecture is as old as architecture
itself, maybe then we will have harder rules to follow. For now, let these
guidelines serve as a touchstone by which to assess the quality of the
Java code that you and your team produce.

One more thing: knowing these won't immediately make you a better software
developer, and working with them for many years doesn't mean you won't make
mistakes. Every piece of code starts as a first draft, like wet clay getting
shaped into its final form. Finally, we chisel away the imperfections when
we review it with our peers. Don't beat yourself up for first drafts that need
improvement. Beat up the code instead!

## **Variables**
### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**
```java
String yyyymmdstr = new SimpleDateFormat("YYYY/MM/DD").format(new Date());
```

**Good:**
```java
String currentDate = new SimpleDateFormat("YYYY/MM/DD").format(new Date());
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

**Bad:**
```java
getUserInfo();
getClientData();
getCustomerRecord();
```

**Good:**
```java
getUser();
```


**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names
We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we
do write is readable and searchable. By *not* naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable.

**Bad:**
```java
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);

```

**Good:**
```java
// Declare them as capitalized `const` globals.
public static final int MILLISECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 86400000;

setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_IN_A_DAY);

```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use explanatory variables
**Bad:**
```java
String address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
String cityZipCodeRegex = "/^[^,\\\\]+[,\\\\\\s]+(.+?)\\s*(\\d{5})?$/";

saveCityZipCode(address.split(cityZipCodeRegex)[0],
                address.split(cityZipCodeRegex)[1]);
```

**Good:**
```java
  String address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
  String cityZipCodeRegex = "/^[^,\\\\]+[,\\\\\\s]+(.+?)\\s*(\\d{5})?$/";

  String city = address.split(cityZipCodeRegex)[0];
  String zipCode = address.split(cityZipCodeRegex)[1];

  saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);

```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Mental Mapping
Don’t force the reader of your code to translate what the variable means.
Explicit is better than implicit.
**Bad:**
```java
String [] l = {"Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"};

for (int i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {
    String li = l[i];
    doStuff();
    doSomeOtherStuff();
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
    // Wait, what is `$li` for again?
    dispatch(li);
 }
```

**Good:**

```java
String[] locations = {"Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"};

for (String location : locations) {
    doStuff();
    doSomeOtherStuff();
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
    dispatch(location);
 }
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't add unneeded context
If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your
variable name.

**Bad:**
```java
class Car {
  public String carMake = "Honda";
  public String carModel = "Accord";
  public String carColor = "Blue";
}

void paintCar(Car car) {
  car.carColor = "Red";
}
```

**Good:**
```java
class Car {
  public String make = "Honda";
  public String model = "Accord";
  public String color = "Blue";
}

void paintCar(Car car) {
  car.color = "Red";
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## **Functions**
### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)
Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it
makes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a
combinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with
each separate argument.

One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have
more than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases
where it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an
argument.



### Functions should do one thing
This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, they can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**
```java
public void emailClients(List<Client> clients) {
    for (Client client : clients) {
        Client clientRecord = repository.findOne(client.getId());
        if (clientRecord.isActive()){
            email(client);
        }
    }
}
```

**Good:**
```java
public void emailClients(List<Client> clients) {
    for (Client client : clients) {
        if (isActiveClient(client)) {
            email(client);
        }
    }
}

private boolean isActiveClient(Client client) {
    Client clientRecord = repository.findOne(client.getId());
    return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Function names should say what they do

**Bad:**
```java
private void addToDate(Date date, int month){
    //..
}

Date date = new Date();

// It's hard to to tell from the method name what is added
addToDate(date, 1);
```
**Good:**
```java
private void addMonthToDate(Date date, int month){
    //..
}

Date date = new Date();
addMonthToDate(1, date);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should only be one level of abstraction
When you have more than one level of abstraction your function is usually
doing too much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier
testing.


### Remove duplicate code
Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because it
means that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to change
some logic.

Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your
tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that
you keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with
tomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!

Oftentimes you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly
different things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you
to have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing
duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of
different things with just one function/module/class.

Getting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the
SOLID principles laid out in the *Classes* section. Bad abstractions can be
worse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make
a good abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, otherwise you'll find yourself
updating multiple places anytime you want to change one thing.

### Don't use flags as function parameters (Avoid Passing Booleans to Functions)
Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.

**Bad:**
```java
  // ❌ Avoid using boolean flags in functions
  distance(pointA, pointB, true)

```

**Good:**

```java

  // ✅ Instead, split the logic in two separate functions
  distanceInKilometers(pointA, pointB)
  distanceInMiles(pointA, pointB)

```

### Avoid Side Effects (part 1)
A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in
and return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file,
modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a
stranger.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to
centralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes
that write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects
without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,
and not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will
be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.


### Avoid Side Effects (part 2)
In JavaScript, primitives are passed by value and objects/arrays are passed by
reference. In the case of objects and arrays, if your function makes a change
in a shopping cart array, for example, by adding an item to purchase,
then any other function that uses that `cart` array will be affected by this
addition. That may be great, however it can be bad too. Let's imagine a bad
situation:

The user clicks the "Purchase", button which calls a `purchase` function that
spawns a network request and sends the `cart` array to the server. Because
of a bad network connection, the `purchase` function has to keep retrying the
request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks "Add to Cart"
button on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?
If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function
will send the accidentally added item because it has a reference to a shopping
cart array that the `addItemToCart` function modified by adding an unwanted
item.

A great solution would be for the `addItemToCart` to always clone the `cart`,
edit it, and return the clone. This ensures that no other functions that are
holding onto a reference of the shopping cart will be affected by any changes.

Two caveats to mention to this approach:
  1. There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,
but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases
are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!

### Avoid conditionals
This seems like an impossible task. Upon first hearing this, most people say,
"how am I supposed to do anything without an `if` statement?" The answer is that
you can use polymorphism to achieve the same task in many cases. The second
question is usually, "well that's great but why would I want to do that?" The
answer is a previous clean code concept we learned: a function should only do
one thing. When you have classes and functions that have `if` statements, you
are telling your user that your function does more than one thing. Remember,
just do one thing.


### Don't over-optimize
Modern browsers do a lot of optimization under-the-hood at runtime. A lot of
times, if you are optimizing then you are just wasting your time. [There are good
resources](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers)
for seeing where optimization is lacking. Target those in the meantime, until
they are fixed if they can be.



### Remove dead code
Dead code is just as bad as duplicate code. There's no reason to keep it in
your codebase. If it's not being called, get rid of it! It will still be safe
in your version history if you still need it.


**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## **Objects and Data Structures**
### Use getters and setters
Using getters and setters to access data on objects could be better than simply
looking for a property on an object. "Why?" you might ask. Well, here's an
unorganized list of reasons why:

* When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
* Makes adding validation simple when doing a `set`.
* Encapsulates the internal representation.
* Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
* You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
server.




### Make objects have private members
This can be accomplished through closures (for ES5 and below).


### Prefer composition over inheritance
As stated famously in [*Design Patterns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by the Gang of Four,
you should prefer composition over inheritance where you can. There are lots of
good reasons to use inheritance and lots of good reasons to use composition.
The main point for this maxim is that if your mind instinctively goes for
inheritance, try to think if composition could model your problem better. In some
cases it can.

You might be wondering then, "when should I use inheritance?" It
depends on your problem at hand, but this is a decent list of when inheritance
makes more sense than composition:

1. Your inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship and not a "has-a"
relationship (Human->Animal vs. User->UserDetails).
2. You can reuse code from the base classes (Humans can move like all animals).
3. You want to make global changes to derived classes by changing a base class.
(Change the caloric expenditure of all animals when they move).


## **SOLID**
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
As stated in Clean Code, "There should never be more than one reason for a class
to change". It's tempting to jam-pack a class with a lot of functionality, like
when you can only take one suitcase on your flight. The issue with this is
that your class won't be conceptually cohesive and it will give it many reasons
to change. Minimizing the amount of times you need to change a class is important.
It's important because if too much functionality is in one class and you modify
a piece of it, it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other
dependent modules in your codebase.



### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
As stated by Bertrand Meyer, "software entities (classes, modules, functions,
etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification." What does that
mean though? This principle basically states that you should allow users to
add new functionalities without changing existing code.



### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
This is a scary term for a very simple concept. It's formally defined as "If S
is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
(i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any
of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed,
etc.)." That's an even scarier definition.

The best explanation for this is if you have a parent class and a child class,
then the base class and child class can be used interchangeably without getting
incorrect results. This might still be confusing, so let's take a look at the
classic Square-Rectangle example. Mathematically, a square is a rectangle, but
if you model it using the "is-a" relationship via inheritance, you quickly
get into trouble.


### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so this principle doesn't apply as strictly
as others. However, it's important and relevant even with JavaScript's lack of
type system.

ISP states that "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that
they do not use." Interfaces are implicit contracts in JavaScript because of
duck typing.

A good example to look at that demonstrates this principle in JavaScript is for
classes that require large settings objects. Not requiring clients to setup
huge amounts of options is beneficial, because most of the time they won't need
all of the settings. Making them optional helps prevent having a
"fat interface".


### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
This principle states two essential things:
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on
abstractions.

This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with AngularJS,
you've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency
Injection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level
modules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up.
It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces
the coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because
it makes your code hard to refactor.

As stated previously, JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so the abstractions
that are depended upon are implicit contracts. That is to say, the methods
and properties that an object/class exposes to another object/class. In the
example below, the implicit contract is that any Request module for an
`InventoryTracker` will have a `requestItems` method.


## **Testing**
Testing is more important than shipping. If you have no tests or an
inadequate amount, then every time you ship code you won't be sure that you
didn't break anything. Deciding on what constitutes an adequate amount is up
to your team, but having 100% coverage (all statements and branches) is how
you achieve very high confidence and developer peace of mind. This means that
in addition to having a great testing framework, you also need to use a
[good coverage tool](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/).

There's no excuse to not write tests. There's plenty of good test frameworks, so find one that your team prefers.
When you find one that works for your team, then aim to always write tests
for every new feature/module you introduce. If your preferred method is
Test Driven Development (TDD), that is great, but the main point is to just
make sure you are reaching your coverage goals before launching any feature,
or refactoring an existing one.

### Single concept per test 

**Bad:**

```js
  describe("MomentJS", () => {
  it("handles date boundaries", () => {
    let date

    date = new MomentJS("1/1/2015")
    date.addDays(30)
    assert.equal("1/31/2015", date)

    date = new MomentJS("2/1/2016")
    date.addDays(28)
    assert.equal("02/29/2016", date)
    })
  })

```



**Good:**

```js
  describe("MomentJS", () => {
    it("handles 30-day months", () => {
      const date = new MomentJS("1/1/2015")
      date.addDays(30)
      assert.equal("1/31/2015", date)
    })

    it("handles leap year", () => {
      const date = new MomentJS("2/1/2016")
      date.addDays(28)
      assert.equal("02/29/2016", date)
    })
  })
```

## **Error Handling**
Thrown errors are a good thing! They mean the runtime has successfully
identified when something in your program has gone wrong and it's letting
you know by stopping function execution on the current stack, killing the
process (in Node), and notifying you in the console with a stack trace.

### Don't ignore caught errors
Doing nothing with a caught error doesn't give you the ability to ever fix
or react to said error. Logging the error to the console (`console.log`)
isn't much better as often times it can get lost in a sea of things printed
to the console. If you wrap any bit of code in a `try/catch` it means you
think an error may occur there and therefore you should have a plan,
or create a code path, for when it occurs.


## **Formatting**
Formatting is subjective. Like many rules herein, there is no hard and fast
rule that you must follow. The main point is DO NOT ARGUE over formatting.
There are tons of tools to automate this.
Use one! It's a waste of time and money for engineers to argue over formatting.

For things that don't fall under the purview of automatic formatting
(indentation, tabs vs. spaces, double vs. single quotes, etc.) look here
for some guidance.

### Use consistent capitalization
JavaScript is untyped, so capitalization tells you a lot about your variables,
functions, etc. These rules are subjective, so your team can choose whatever
they want. The point is, no matter what you all choose, just be consistent.




### Function callers and callees should be close
If a function calls another, keep those functions vertically close in the source
file. Ideally, keep the caller right above the callee. We tend to read code from
top-to-bottom, like a newspaper. Because of this, make your code read that way.


## **Comments**
### Only comment things that have business logic complexity.
Comments are an apology, not a requirement. Good code *mostly* documents itself.

**Bad:**
```java
// Creating a List of customer names 
List<String> customerNames = Arrays.asList('Bob', 'Linda', 'Steve', 'Mary'); 

// Using Stream findFirst() 
Optional<String> firstCustomer = customerNames.stream().findFirst(); 

// if the stream is empty, an empty 
// Optional is returned. 
if (firstCustomer.isPresent()) { 
    System.out.println(firstCustomer.get()); 
} 
else { 
    System.out.println("no value"); 
} 
```


**Good:**
```java
List<String> customerNames = Arrays.asList('Bob', 'Linda', 'Steve', 'Mary'); 

Optional<String> firstCustomer = customerNames.stream().findFirst(); 

if (firstCustomer.isPresent()) { 
    System.out.println(firstCustomer.get()); 
} 
else { 
    System.out.println("no value"); 
} 
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or a Variable
The best comment is no comment

**Bad:**
```java
//Check to see if order is eligible to ship
if((order.isPaid & order.isLabeled) && CUSTOMER_FLAG) {
  // ...
}
```


**Good:**
```java
if(order.isEligibleToShip()) {
  // ...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't leave commented out code in your codebase
Version control exists for a reason. Leave old code in your history.

**Bad:**
```java
doStuff();
// doOtherStuff();
// doSomeMoreStuff();
// doSoMuchStuff();
```


**Good:**
```java
doStuff();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't have journal comments
Remember, use version control! There's no need for dead code, commented code,
and especially journal comments. Use `git log` to get history!

**Bad:**
```java
/**
 * 2021-03-06: Renamed clean to cleanCode (DL)
 * 2020-01-03: Changed return value (LB)
 * 2019-05-12: Added clean method (DL)
 */
 cleanCode(String code) {
   return null;
 }
```

**Good:**
```java
 cleanCode(String code) {
   return null;
 }
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid positional markers
They usually just add noise. Let the functions and variable names along with the
proper indentation and formatting give the visual structure to your code.

**Bad:**
```java
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Instantiate Order List
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
List<Order> orders = new ArrayList();

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Ship Orders that are eligible
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
orders.filter(Order::isEligibleToShip).forEach(x -> ship(x));
```

**Good:**
```java
List<Order> orders = new ArrayList();

orders.filter(Order::isEligibleToShip).forEach(x -> ship(x));
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**
